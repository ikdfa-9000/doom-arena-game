# DOOM ARENA PROJECT - Game Repository

Repository for the game itself, main menu can be found [here](https://github.com/ikdfa-9000/doom-arena-project)
Why am I even doing this... anyways, there are known bugs:
* First shotgun fire sequence after selecting the weapon resets hand animation for a while. Easy fix, just not in the mood bruh

## THIS PROJECT IS VERY FAR FROM FINISHED
